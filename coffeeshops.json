    "Time Visited": "May 2025",
    "What we ordered": "Italian soda and an iced vanilla latte",
    "Vibe":  "It was a bit cramped and noisy at the location if you're looking to do something that requires focus. It's very good for chatting and having fun though",
    "Would I come back?": "Yes!",
    "Seating": "There is some seating but not a ton of space. The tables aren't huge if you're hoping to work on your laptop or study with a friend. However, there's enough space for cups and plates",
    "Wifi": "Unsure",
    "Power Outlet": "Unsure; most tables aren't near a wall and probably wouldn't reach a power outlet anyways",
    "Comments": "Barista was very friendly and nice. We chatted a bit. Our drinks were ready quick. My Italian soda was very tasty. It came with a recyclable bamboo straw. The straw was environmental and actually leaked a little. I liked the leaking because it forced me to savor the drink and take my time. It was like a slow-feeder. The area is decently walkable. There is street parking and shops nearby. It's in a strip mall."

    "Vibe": "Really good ambiance. It feels comfortable to both chat and work quietly.",
    "Would I come back?": "Yes!",
    "Seating": "Lots of seating and a large space that isn't too cramped. Comfortable chairs and tables that can hold a book or a laptop",
    "Wifi": "Yes",
    "Power Outlet": "Yes",
    "Comments": "The guava syrup was very tasty and I'd get it in my drink again. The coffee flight is so creative with unique flavors! We wish some of the coffee flight drinks were on the regular menu as full-sized drinks. The Earl Grey cream soda was delicious. The prices were average and not too high. It's in a decently walkable location off Whyte ave. One of the flight drinks was a cookie with milk, which sounds fun initially but ultimately is just a glass of milk. Some of the drinks were a bigger hit with us than others."

    "Comments": "The shop is downtown by Corona station. There are lot of things to do nearby, but if you drove, you'll be met with standard downtown parking (paid). I often see people studying here. The drinks are okay. The star of the show are the pastries, especially croissants. They are unique with lots of variety, and they have trendy items you'd see on TikTok."

    "Comments": "My tea was okay. The prices are at the higher end for an Edmonton spot at $7+ without tax for some flavored lattes. The honey lavender latte did not taste like honey nor lavender. Then there's my cupcake. It looked amazing on the outside. The cake was fine. The icing was clumpy and somehow tasted like nothing. It wasn't even sweet. If you do go, stick with simple food items and drinks"
